## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Despite my best effort, there are still numerous features left uncompleted at this moment.

- Navigation: dropdown links and their hover effects.

- The News Carousel

Hopefully, I could develop these above two features very soon.

Also, some parts still look amiss right now and need more polishing.

- The Android News Section: the image and content proportion still seems off visually.

- The CSS is kind of a mass now. It's hard to read and unorganized. Rewrite in the future.

Any feedback or advice is highly welcomed!
